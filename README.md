# Convolutional Neural Networks for EEG Data Categorization

This repository houses a convolutional neural network built using the [Keras machine learning framework](https://keras.io/). The purpose of the network is to decode EEG data. Specifically decode object recognition data collected from users viewing 6 different categories of images (human body, human face, animal body, animal face, inanimate natural object, and inanimate man-made object). a test bank of 72 images were displayed to users and can be seen below. to find out more about data collection and procedure please visit the page for the [original research](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0135697)
